#### Message from the team:

We heartfully thank the members at E-Cell of IIIT Pune for providing us with this wonderful opportunity to think outside of the box. We had fun coming up with the website and the product itself. We learnt a lot of new technologies which improved our skills and taught us how to manage time, sharing work load and delegating the team to work on different things. With a fix 50 hour hackathon time-window, we had taken over such a huge task of finishing this website and it was an incredible feeling of accomplishment after 35 commits on GitHub.

We also thank the members for thier continuous doubt clarification and mentorship during the mid-evaluation. We were able to add features we hadn't thought of with their suggestions. Proper timing was followed and all details were provided in time for us.

Thank You,
Shreyas and Mehsheed
